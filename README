This repo is for useful '.emacs' files for GNU Emacs.  

Here is a link to all the Emacs packages referenced by the Mac OS X version of the '.emacs' file (found under 'aquamacs', above): https://www.dropbox.com/s/0dewvywod20lxtq/opt.local.share.emacs.tar.gz

Mac OS X
--------------

Aquamacs is great and can be found at: http://aquamacs.org/  

Note that only Aquamacs needs the file, 'customizations.el' (a sample one is located under 'aquamacs', here).

The 'aquamacs' .emacs file works as well on plain Mac OS X GNU Emacs, as found at: http://emacsformacosx.com/
