Overview
========
This repo is for useful '.emacs' files for GNU Emacs.  The approach is to add intuitive extensions that never modify built-in Emacs bindings and standard behaviors.
There has been a welcome wave of recent Emacs development and usage, but it has been accompanied by some unfortunate overrides of default behavior.


Installation
============

Installation instructions can be found in the `.emacs` files.  The `.emacs` file currently works on both Mac OS X and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. See the section below about Mac OS X for tips on installation there.

The `.emacs_centos-5` file is rather out of date at this point, but should still work.

The `.emacs` file can be adopted wholesale.  But as a rule of thumb, only add code into your `.emacs` file that you fully understand.  So often, the adoption model is to try out select segments of other `.emacs` files one at a time.

Usage
=====
See the [Quick Start](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s34/sh/5184e1d3-eff7-4c36-b534-a29c5228ba49/f9b67f773d4666deb0437e084b2d2dd2) guide, and optionally, the [Extras](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s34/sh/af6a83c4-4853-42c4-822a-b345d457ee66/8fbbda7b8f281c6fbfae97842088e72d) guide.  
The official manual and numerous books fill in the gaps. 

Mac OS X
========

For Mac, the vanilla build is recommended since it supports a very current version of Emacs: [http://emacsformacosx.com/](http://emacsformacosx.com/)

Aquamacs
--------
  * Aquamacs is great, but at the time of this writing, outdated since it is built with Emacs 23.
  * It can be found at: [http://aquamacs.org/](http://aquamacs.org/)
  * Here is a link to all the Emacs packages referenced by the Aquamacs Mac OS X version of the '.emacs' file (found under 'aquamacs', above): [https://www.dropbox.com/s/0dewvywod20lxtq/opt.local.share.emacs.tar.gz](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0dewvywod20lxtq/opt.local.share.emacs.tar.gz)
  * Note that only Aquamacs needs the file, 'customizations.el' (a sample one is located under 'aquamacs', here).
