Overview
========
This repo is for useful '.emacs' files for GNU Emacs.


Installation
============

Installation instructions can be found in the `.emacs` files.  The `.emacs` file currently works on both Mac OS X and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. See the section below about Mac OS X for tips on installation there.

The `.emacs_centos-5` file is rather out of date at this point, but should still work.

Mac OS X
========

For Mac, the vanilla build is recommended since it supports a very current version of Emacs: [http://emacsformacosx.com/](http://emacsformacosx.com/)

Aquamacs
--------
  * Aquamacs is great, but at the time of this writing, outdated since it is built with Emacs 23.
  * It can be found at: [http://aquamacs.org/](http://aquamacs.org/)
  * Here is a link to all the Emacs packages referenced by the Aquamacs Mac OS X version of the '.emacs' file (found under 'aquamacs', above): [https://www.dropbox.com/s/0dewvywod20lxtq/opt.local.share.emacs.tar.gz](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0dewvywod20lxtq/opt.local.share.emacs.tar.gz)
  * Note that only Aquamacs needs the file, 'customizations.el' (a sample one is located under 'aquamacs', here).
